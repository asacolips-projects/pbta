## BREAKING CHANGES
- `steps` (a property of Clocks and XP) has been removed. This should only affect modules that had their own `actors-attributes` template.

## Playbook improvements:
- Added Stats under the Details tab.
  - You can set the initial array of stats of a playbook.
  - Adding a playbook to an actor will replace its stats.
- Added Attributes.
  - You need to edit each attribute to have a `playbook = true` (TOML) or `playbook: true` (JS) property.
  	- It also accepts slugs for exclusive attributes (e.g. `playbook = "the-angel"`).
- Added Item Granting.
  - When the playbook is added to an actor, the initial choices will be granted to the actor.
    - Moves can't be of a type that is already granted at character creation (e.g. Basic Moves).
  - Other sets can be created but there is no feature to handle them yet.

## Sheet Improvements
- **Actor Sheet:** New items have their sheets opened on creation.
- **Move Sheet:** Stats are displayed in a group on the selector.
- **Sheet Config:** The default `max` attribute of Clocks, XP, and Resources has been increase to 1.

## Rolls
- The rendering of Roll messages has been changed under the hood, so expect old roll messages to not be displayed correctly, but new ones should be fine.
- Ongoing/Forward are no longer applied automatically. The user now can choose when the modifiers apply.

## Styling changes
- Font Sizes were rewritten to use Foundry's variables.
- Reduced the padding of tabs.
