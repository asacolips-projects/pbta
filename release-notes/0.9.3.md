## Localization Improvements
- Fixed bug with `util.getPlaybooks()` running before Babele had a chance to localize compendium content. (@DjLeChuck)

## Fixes
- Added `choices` back to the DataModel. Existing data shouldn't have been lost when this field was accidentally removed, but new choices wouldn't have been able to be created while it was missing.
- Fixed bug with `enrichHTML()` causing data on item sheets to be enriched prior to saving to the database.

## Development
- Added new Handlebars helper, `getValue` to support retrieving a value by key in Handlebars. This was mostly necessary due to how moveResults is an object that we iterate through.
